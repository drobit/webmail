2. **Comment on an issue** you'd like to work on
3. **Wait for assignment** from maintainers
4. **Start working** once assigned

For new contributors, look for issues labeled:

- `documentation`

## üìù Coding Standards

### Rust Code Style

Follow standard Rust conventions:

```bash
# Format your code before committing
cargo fmt

# Check for common mistakes
cargo clippy

# Run all checks
cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo test
```

### Code Quality Guidelines

1. **Write clear, readable code**:
```rust
// Good: Clear function name and documentation
/// Extracts readable text content from email body
fn extract_plain_text(body: &str) -> String {
    // Implementation...
}

// Avoid: Unclear naming
fn process(data: &str) -> String {
    // Implementation...
}
```

2. **Handle errors properly**:
```rust
// Good: Proper error handling
match fetch_emails().await {
    Ok(emails) => process_emails(emails),
    Err(e) => {
        eprintln!("Failed to fetch emails: {}", e);
        return Err(e);
    }
}

// Avoid: Unwrapping without context
let emails = fetch_emails().await.unwrap();
```

3. **Write meaningful comments**:
```rust
// Good: Explains why, not what
// Use UID-based lookup for faster email access
let email = get_email_by_uid(uid).await?;

// Avoid: Obvious comments
// Get email by UID
let email = get_email_by_uid(uid).await?;
```

4. **Use appropriate data structures**:
```rust
// Good: Use Vec for ordered collections
let mut emails: Vec<EmailDetail> = Vec::new();

// Good: Use HashMap for key-value lookups
let mut cache: HashMap<String, EmailDetail> = HashMap::new();
```

### Frontend Guidelines

1. **Use modern JavaScript** (ES6+)
2. **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase
3. **Write semantic HTML** with proper accessibility
4. **Use CSS classes** instead of inline styles
5. **Handle errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_email_validation

# Run tests in specific module
cargo test lib::tests
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Unit tests** for individual functions:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_validate_email_format() {
        assert!(validate_email_format("test@example.com"));
        assert!(!validate_email_format("invalid-email"));
    }
}
```

2. **Integration tests** for API endpoints:
```rust
#[actix_web::test]
async fn test_fetch_emails() {
    let app = test::init_service(create_app()).await;
    let req = test::TestRequest::get()
        .uri("/emails?limit=10")
        .to_request();
    let resp = test::call_service(&app, req).await;
    assert!(resp.status().is_success());
}
```

3. **Property-based tests** for complex logic:
```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_email_truncation(s in "\\PC*", max_len in 1usize..100) {
        let result = truncate_subject(&s, max_len);
        assert!(result.len() <= max_len);
    }
}
```

### Test Requirements

- **Bug fixes** should include regression tests
- **Aim for 80%+ code coverage** on new code
